# Figure 2

## Code run on compute cluster

Figure 2 uses the roary orthogroup presence absence table as described for Fig1. This table was manually subsetted in Excel for orthogroups representing T3E homologs, by searching for the patterns "Xop", "Avr", "Rip", "Hop".

## Code to generate figure

`figure2.R` generates the phylogenetic tree (like in Fig 1) and the type three effector presence-absence heatmap. Some manual adaptation in Adobe Illustrator is required to align the phylogenetic tree with the facetted heatmap!
