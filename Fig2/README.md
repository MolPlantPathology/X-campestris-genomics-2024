# Figure 2

## Code run on compute cluster

Figure 2 uses the roary orthogroup presence absence table as described for Fig1. This table was manually subsetted for orthogroups representing T3E homologs.

## Code to generate figure

`figure2.R` generates the phylogenetic tree (like in Fig 1) and the type three effector presence-absence heatmap. Some manual adaptation in Adobe Illustrator is required to align the phylogenetic tree with the facetted heatmap!
