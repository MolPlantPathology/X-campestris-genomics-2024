# *X. campestris* genomics study

This repository contains code and data related to the study by Paauw *et al.* (2024) (add link!) on genomics of *X. campestris*. The repository functions as a scripts and data archive, not as a complete description and interpretation of all datasets and analysis steps. For that, we refer to our paper in *Current Biology*. 

## Organization

We share the commands used to assemble and annotate the genomes in the folder `genome_assembly`. The other folders are organized by figure, referring to the figure numbers of the Paauw et al paper. For each figure, the documentation is divided by (i) the steps run on the compute cluster Crunchomics, and (ii) the steps to generate the plots shown in the figures. During the study, the genomes of different isolates are referred to as 'barcode`xx`', with `xx` ranging from `00` to `96`. To map the barcode numbers to isolate name, use Table S1 in Paauw et al. paper.
