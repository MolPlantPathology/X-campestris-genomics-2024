# *X. campestris* genomics study

This repository contains code and data related to the study by Paauw *et al.* (2024) (add link!) on genomics of *X. campestris*. It must be noted that the repository functions as a scripts and data archive, not as a complete description and interpretation of all datasets and analysis steps. For that, we refer to our paper in *Current Biology*. 

## Organization

The code and data is organized by figure, referring to the figure numbers of the Paauw et al paper. In addition, we share the commands used to assemble and annotate the genomes. During the study, the genomes of different isolates are referred to as 'barcode`xx`', with `xx` ranging from `00` to `96`. To map the barcode numbers to isolate name, use Table S1 in Paauw et al. paper.
