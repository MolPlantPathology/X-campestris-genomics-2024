# *X. campestris* genomics study

This repository contains code and data related to the study by Paauw *et al.* (2024) (add link!) on genomics of *X. campestris*.

## Organization

The code and data is organized by figure, referring to the figure numbers of the Paauw et al paper. In addition, we share the commands used to assemble and annotate the genomes. During the study, the genomes of different isolates are referred to as 'barcode`xx`', with `xx` ranging from `00` to `96`. To map the barcode numbers to isolate name, use Table S1 in Paauw et al. paper.
